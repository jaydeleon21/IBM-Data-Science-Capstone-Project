INTRODUCTION

On its website, SpaceX promotes Falcon 9 rocket launches at 62 million dollars; other suppliers charge upwards of 165 million dollars for each launch, and a large portion of the savings is due to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage. So, if we can figure out whether the first stage will land, we can figure out how much a launch will cost. If another business wishes to submit a proposal for a rocket launch against SpaceX, they can use this information. The project's objective is to build a machine-learning pipeline to forecast whether the first stage will successfully land.
