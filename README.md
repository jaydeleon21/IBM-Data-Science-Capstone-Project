While other companies charge upwards of 165 million dollars per launch, SpaceX, a revolutionary firm, offers rocket launches, notably Falcon 9 launches, for as little as 62 million dollars. The majority of these savings can be attributed to SpaceX's brilliant idea to reuse the launch's first stage by re-landing the rocket for the following flight. The price will decrease considerably more if this method is repeated. The objective of my project, which I am working on as a data scientist for a firm that competes with SpaceX, is to build a machine learning pipeline to forecast how the first stage will land in the future. The success of this initiative will determine how much to offer SpaceX for a rocket launch.
